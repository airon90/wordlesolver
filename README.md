[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)
([Gurgle](https://github.com/billthefarmer/gurgle)) solver with code

See https://github.com/PoorLazyCoder/Wordle-Solver for explanation.

 * Multiple coloured themes

Usually solves [Wordle](href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle)
and [Gurgle](https://github.com/billthefarmer/gurgle) puzzles in four
tries.

Uses solver code from
[Wordle-Solver](https://github.com/PoorLazyCoder/Wordle-Solver).

Letters that are shown green in the game
([Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle),
[Gurgle](https://github.com/billthefarmer/gurgle)) go in the first
green row in the correct place. Yellow letters go in the next yellow
rows in the correct place. Letters shown grey go in the last row in
any order.

Tap either the next button on the keyboard or the solve button in the
toolbar. The next button only works if there is text where the cursor
is, so it can be used to move to the next slot without triggering a
search. The app will show a scrolling list of possible next guesses at
the bottom.

Select coloured theme from the **Theme** button in the toolbar.
